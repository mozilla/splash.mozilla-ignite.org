            <h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Q. What is US Ignite?</h3>

<p>US Ignite is a National Science Foundation initiative to explore the potential of next-generation networks. Mozilla is partnering with NSF to run an apps challenge for the US Ignite initiative.

<p>US Ignite seeks to develop applications and services for ultra-fast broadband networks. It will foster the creation of novel applications and digital experiences that have the potential to transform areas of national priority such as healthcare, education and job skills training, public safety, energy, and advanced manufacturing. Read more at the <a href="http://us-ignite.org">US Ignite website</a>.

<h3>Q. What is an open innovation challenge?</h3>

<p>Mozilla’s open innovation challenges gather the best and brightest to identify promising ideas and move them from concept to prototype to implementation. 

<p>The model draws upon themes and methodologies similar to design-based research, especially in translating theories of complex systems to practical problems within a given, specified, challenging, and collaborative learning environment. 

<h3>Q. How do I enter?</h3>

<p>There's a few ways to enter the challenge.

{{show graphic}}

<p><strong>In January</strong>, you can join the ideas challenge—a massive group brainstorm and discussion. How would you use next the generation of networks and web technologies to bring benefit to people's lives? You can submit an idea, or discuss the ideas with the community.

<p>The ideas will be reviewed by a panel of developers, businesspeople, VCs, visionaries, and citizens. Winners will earn recognition for their ideas, and an opportunity to attend an in-person hack day—where we'll explore what it will take to make these ideas a reality.

<p><strong>In February</strong>, you can apply for the development challenge. The applications will be reviewed by Mozilla and NSF. Accepted teams will get mentorship, advice from GENI and Mozilla developers, and funding based on need and potential.

<p>You can also join the conversation in a number of webinars, live events, and discussion spaces at mozillaignite.org.

<h3>Q. Who should compete?</h3>

<p>The challenge is open for all to enter. If you're a web developer, university researcher, start-up or visionary, we encourage you to enter and develop an app from the future.

<p>This is a good chance to get your feet wet with HTML5, software defined networking, and other new technologies. It's also a good way to pursue experimentation without investing a lot of time in a complex funding application.

<h3>Q. Do I need to compete in the ideas challenge in order to compete in the development challenge?</h3>

<p>No—anyone can compete in the development challenge. The ideas challenge is not a prerequisite.

That said, the ideas challenge is an excellent way to discover, synthesize, and refine thinking around "apps from the future." And through the ideas challenge, you may find like-minded people to join your team and compete in the development challenge.

<h3>Q. How does the funding process work?</h3>

<p>Rather than a winner-takes-all approach, the Mozilla Ignite apps challenge uses an "iterative funding" process.

<p>Teams will develop their apps in public, in real-time. They'll be required to blog regularly and commit their code to public repositories so they can get help, advice, and contributions from the community.

<p>Throughout the challenge, the challenge jury will meet and award teams for the progress and promise they show. 

<p>There are a few benefits to this approach:
<ul>
<li>For teams competing in the challenge, dollars start to flow <em>quickly</em>—so they can afford to get out on a limb and try risky ideas.</li>
<li>Real progress is rewarded, based on merit. The proof is in the pudding.</li>
<li>Teams with crazy ambitious ideas can compete side-by-side with smaller experiments.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll publish the guidelines and award amounts in early January.

<h3>Q. Do I need to be a U.S. citizen to compete?</h3>

<p>No, anyone can compete in the ideas challenge and the development challenge.

<p>However, as this is a federally-funded initiative, each team must designate a fiscal agent who will accept awards on the team's behalf. Only U.S.-incorporated organizations and citizens can accept awards.

<p>Practically, this means that teams can have members from all over the world—but must also have at least one team member, or a host, in the United States.

<h3>Q. Do I keep my intellectual property?</h3>

<p>Absolutely. 

<p>We hope that many of the apps developed in this challenge will become commercially viable. And we want to encourage entrepreneurial exploration at the edges of the network. If you develop something awesome in this challenge, it's yours to go monetize (or not).

<p>That said, another objective of this challenge is to build an open development community around GENI, the open web, and other open technologies. And we think that open source is one of the most powerful ways to do that. So all competing apps must publish their code, and choose a suitably open license. Check the official rules in early January for more details.

<h3>Q. What do you mean by "apps"?</h3>

<p>With the help of the National Science Foundation, a bunch of smart folks have banded together to create GENI, a virtual laboratory at the frontiers of network science and engineering.

<p>It’s a place where the brightest minds can come together to envision and make real the possibilities of future internets.

<p>Of course, these apps will run in modern web browsers, and will capitalize on all the newest open web technologies—HTML5, fast javascript, device APIs, hardware acceleration, WebRTC, WebGL, WebCL, and more.

<p>And with HTML5, WebGL, Websockets and Canvas, we have all the necessary technology on hand to collaboratively develop experiences that will span browsers, mobile, TVs, and other access points we can scarcely imagine. 

<h3>Q. Are there any limits on what I can build?</h3>

<p>Only a few. Your app must use GENI in a novel way; all client-side code must use HTML5 and open web technologies (that means no Flash, iOS, or other proprietary runtimes); and it must demonstrate some public benefit (so no games for games' sake).

<p>And, of course, you must not violate the GENI acceptable use policies. So nothing illegal, distasteful, or dangerous.
            
<h3>Q. What is GENI?</h3>

<p>GENI, the "Global Environment for Network Innovations," is a sandboxed experimenters' network. It's like a scale model of many future internets. And it's where you'll develop and deploy apps in the Mozilla Ignite apps challenge. <p>What makes it unique?

<ul>
<li>it’s fast. at least 100MBps fast. up to 1GBps in some places.</li>
<li>it's built around principles of “software-defined networking,” which lets developers program the network like it’s a computer.</li>
<li>developers can take a slice of the network and create their own virtual networks</li>
<li>developers can access Layer 2 network resources, getting more control and flexibility than what’s afforded by internet protocol</li>
<li>there’s computing and storage clusters at every point in the network— “programmable local clouds” — so developers can optimize computing, storage, and networking aspects of their apps, simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Q. Is GENI access locally restricted? (US only)</h3>

<p>A. 

<h3>Q. Is this just about network speed?</h3>

<p>No! Building the internet of the future is not just about increasing network speed. It's about designing web applications that can take advantage of networks that are not only faster but smarter -- allowing developers to program the network itself in new ways.

<p>In the web of the future, innovation will happen on the network level, not just application layer. GENI anables the kind of experimentation that happens between clients and servers. Developers can test new paradigms like cloud computation, specialized P2P networks, programmable network switches, and OpenFlow.

<h3>Q. I'm new to OpenFlow, software defined networking, and slices. How can I get started?</h3>

<p>We are working on webinars, documentation, and other resources to get you up to speed.

<p>The GENI Experimenter's Portal is also good resource. You can learn about software and templates you can use to get up and running on GENI.

<h3>Q. How do open web technologies play into this?</h3>

<p>We think that HTML5 will be the universal run-time of the future. Write once, run everywhere—whether that's on a desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile, car, toaster, or laundry machine.

<p>We think that the deeply connected future needs a common, freely implementable, consensus-based development standard. And we think that HTML5 is that standard.

<p>Check out MDN. Allude to disappearing distinction between local and remote, chrome and chromeless.

{{Ask Christian H and Joe Stagnaro for language to go here—talk about our chromeless work, B2G, web runtime, and the practical developer benefits}}

<h3>Q. Why is Mozilla doing this?</h3>

<p>Mozilla's mission is to shape future of Internet as public resource—offering choice, transparency, and control to developers and users.

<p>By working with researchers, developers, and businesspeople, we can drive innovation that benefits people in their everyday lives—and that keeps the internet open and competitive.
